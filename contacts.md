## For Those Who Want to Join Us

Graduate schools and undergraduate schools have differences. Graduate school is a place to learn specialized knowledge and making own research. Therefore, unless you find what you have fun and interest in your research, you will not spend meaningful days in our laboratory. And also, you will have difficulties and troubles during your research. Our laboratory welcomes the students who have the mind to overcome the difficulties and make good research together.
